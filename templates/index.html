<h1 class="logo">What is The GenderMag Automated Inclusivity Detector?
</h1> <br><br><br><br>


		<p align = "justify" style="font-size:20px; width: 90%"> This tool attempts to emulate a <a href="http://gendermag.org/" target="_blank">GenderMag</a> software evaluation session and takes as input the data required when performing such a session, and checks for three decision rules. 
		<!-- That is, the input is the use-case, subgoal, and action used in the GenderMag session, along with the webpage to be evaluated. <br> <br> --> <br>

		The three decision rules are detailed below: <br>
	<!-- 	From this input, the tool extracts the subgoal and action using natural language process and checks for three decision rules. These decision rules are detailed below (Click on the blue arrows for more detailed explanations): <br> -->
	<details>
  <summary style="font-size:20px;">Rule 1: Cues to needed information</summary>
	<p style="font-size:18px;">The first rule in our set checks for situations where users like <a href = "http://gendermag.org/Foundations.html" target = "_blank">Abi</a> would not find all the information they need to complete their task. 
	<!-- For example, the wording of the subgoal serves as the information that Abi seeks, and the words from actions serve as cues to direct Abi to a UI action. Without such cues, Abi would face difficulty finding all the information they need.  -->
	</p>
	</details> 

	<details>
  <summary style="font-size:20px;">Rule 2: Situating Abi in the context of the action performed</summary>
	<p style="font-size:18px;">On clicking a link, the destination page should offer cues to help <a href = "http://gendermag.org/Foundations.html" target = "_blank">Abi</a> understand that they have reached the right place. If a webpage fails to use words similar to what a link's description hinted at, users like Abi could get confused. 
	</p>
	</details> 

	<details>
  <summary style="font-size:20px;">Rule 3: Information link navigation</summary>
	<p style="font-size:18px;">Users like <a href = "http://gendermag.org/Foundations.html" target = "_blank">Abi</a> click on a link only after gathering enough information and planning their next step. Labeled and descriptive links provide Abi with information about the webpage they are supposed to visit. Rule 3 captures this tenet.

<!-- 		The GenderMag Method (short for <u>Gender</u> Inclusiveness <u>Mag</u>nifier) is a method for finding gender-inclusiveness issues in software features. Using GenderMag, software developers and/or user experience (UX) teams can evaluate their software from a gender-inclusiveness perspective. Fixing issues that may disproportionately affect one gender over another can lead to better usability for everyone. <br>
