<u>Results for this page:</u> <br/>
      <p style="color: orange"><br>Rule 1 is violated: Some keywords Abi was looking for, were not found on the webpage.<br></p>The subgoal keywords for this instance were: ['SUB'], and the action keywords were: ['AC'].<br><p style="color: green"><br> Rule 2 not applicable since it is a before-action webpage.</p><p style="color: orange"><br>Rule 3 violated: Links are not labelled. Please refer to the right side to see the highlighted links (in yellow).<br></p><br><br>Read below for descriptions of each rule: <br><br>Rule 1: Keywords from subgoals and associated actions should be present on the webpage. <br>The wording of the subgoal serves as the information that Abi seeks, and the words from actions serve as cues to direct Abi to a UI action. Without such cues, Abi would face difficulty finding all the information they need. <br><br>Rule 2: Linked pages should contain keywords from link labels. <br> On clicking a link, the destination page should offer cues to help Abiâ€™s understand that they have reached the right place. If a project page fails to use words similar to what a link label hinted at, Abi could get confused. <br><br>Rule 3: Links should be labeled with a keyword or phrase. Abi clicks on a link only after gathering enough information and planning their next step. Labeled links provide Abi with information about the webpage they are supposed to visit.<br>
