"pdf Example cognitive style descriptions:   Your Instructor Lara  I'm mostly a Tim: I tend to leap into uncertainty, throw caution to the wind, and search for the path of least resistance (and use too many idioms)",Not
"But in high-risk, high-reward situations, I become careful, detail-oriented, and try to figure out all the steps that'll lead to the outcome I want---I'm like Abi",Not
"Overall, I often wish I was more like Abi so I wouldn't get into so much trouble",Not
"then again, the Tim side of me is ok with mistakes! Two of my facet values are: Information Processing Style: I get dozens of work emails each day",Not
"When they're from students, one of my bosses, or colleagues I work closely with, I'm like Abi (comprehensive)---I read the messages fully, carefully, and often multiple times",Not
"For other emails, I'm like Tim (selective)---I skim the first couple sentences or bolded text to decide whether the email is worth looking at",Not
"Attitude Toward Risk: I'm risk-tolerant about decisions, but risk-averse about time expenditure",Not
"I got a pollution sensor recently, here's what I did at turbo speed: (1) Ripped the sensor out of the package, (2) threw the user manual across the room, (3) jammed the USB into my computer, (4) Google'd around for the sensor software",Not
Google'd some more,Not
Google'd,Not
"couldn't find the software, (5) picked up the manual off the floor to get the URL for the sensor manufacturer website, (6) finally broke down and read a whole webpage and found the very poorly-labeled software download link",Not
I see aspects of both Tim and Abi in there,Not
Your TA  I identify with Pat’s facet values most of the time,Not
"Occasionally, I might behave a bit more like Abi by being more process-oriented in my learning style",Not
Two of my facet values are: Motivation: I’m very motivated by task completion,Not
I rarely learn all the cool new features that are released when my device or app updates,Not
"In fact, I’ll try to avoid updating as long as possible if my technology is allowing me to accomplish my task",Not
Learning by Process vs,Not
"Tinkering: Similar to Pat, I usually learn new technology by tinkering around with it",Not
"Occasionally, I behave more like Abi if I think the hardware or software is more complex",Not
"For instance, I learned how to use Slack by clicking on different icons and seeing what happened, but I walked through the tutorial to learn how to use my favorite IDE",Not
Your TA  Two of my facet values: Motivation: It depends on what I'm using the software for,Not
"If it is for work, I tend to be like Abi and use the technologies to accomplish my tasks",Not
I may learn new technologies if I find it not too difficult or time-consuming,Not
"On the other hand, if it is for my hobbies or something outside my job, I like to explore and see what's available for me and enjoy trying something new",Not
Information Processing Style: Comprehensive like Abi and Pat,Not
I want to ensure I read all the information I need to understand and see a clearer picture of what I am going to do before I get started,Not
Your TA  I generally identify with Tim’s facet values,Not
I enjoy learning technologies and learn best by tinkering,Not
I share Tim’s qualities of being risk tolerant and I love to tinker and explore and can lose myself in finding out new things when I need to turn back to the tasks at hand,Not
"However, I also share some qualities with Pat in that I will carefully examine where I have gone wrong if something is not having a desired outcome and am not so quick to blame the software creator",Not
Two of my facet values: Attitude Toward Risk: I am tolerant of risking time and resources to spend on an idea or product that may or may not turn out as long as there is a potential for a large ROI (Return of Investment),Not
I’m always looking for different ways to organize and automate the tasks I do to increase efficiency and with that sometimes there is the possibility of actually decreasing efficiency,Not
It’s important I continue to recognize and utilize what works and stop using what doesn’t work and try other avenues,Not
Information Processing Style: I very closely manage my time and try to increase efficiency,Not
So in most areas I like to get to the main point of the topic,Not
This can backfire if I don’t read enough ancillary details to understand the main point and need to go back and take those in,Not
I very much dive headfirst into a project and work from the middle to the back and front,Not
Your TA  I identify most with Pat,Not
"However, sometimes my facet values become more like Tim's",Not
I always want to learn all available functionalities on every tech device or appliance that I own,Not
Two of my facet values: Computer Self-Efficacy: Medium confidence doing unfamiliar tech tasks,Not
"For example, if I can't fix a problem in some new programming language, I will keep trying and if it's still not resolved, maybe seek help",Not
Attitude Toward Risk: Risk-averse,Not
"For example, before pushing code for production, I always read it multiple times although it's tested",Not
